#pragma mark - Delegate

@property (nonatomic, weak) id <PSTreeGraphDelegate> delegate;


#pragma mark - Parent Resize Notification

/// Use this method to keep the view in sync for now.

- (void) parentClipViewDidResize:(id)object;


#pragma mark - Creating Instances

/// Initializes a new TreeGraph instance.  (TreeGraph's designated initializer is the same as
/// UIView's: -initWithFrame:.)  The TreeGraph has default appearance properties and layout
/// metrics, but to have a usable TreeGraph with actual content, you need to specify a
/// nodeViewNibName and a modelRoot.

- (id) initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame;


#pragma mark - Connection to Model

/// The root of the model node tree that the TreeGraph is being asked to display.  (The modelRoot
/// may have ancestor nodes, but TreeGraph will ignore them and treat modelRoot as the root.)  May
/// be set to nil, in which case the TreeGraph displays no content.  The modelRoot object, and all
/// of its desdendants as exposed through recursive application of the "-childModelNodes" accessor
/// to traverse the model tree, must conform to the TreeGraphModelNode protocol declared in
/// TreeGraphModelNode.h

@property (nonatomic, strong) id <PSTreeGraphModelNode> modelRoot;


#pragma mark - Root SubtreeView Access

/// A TreeGraph builds the tree it displays using recursively nested SubtreeView instances.  This
/// read-only accessor provides a way to get the rootmost SubtreeView (the one that corresponds
/// to the modelRoot model node).

@property (nonatomic, readonly) PSBaseSubtreeView *rootSubtreeView;


#pragma mark - Node View Nib Specification

/// The name of the .nib file from which to instantiate node views.  (This API design assumes that
/// all node views should be instantiated from the same .nib.  If a tree of heterogeneous nodes
/// was desired, we could switch to a different mechanism for identifying the .nib to instantiate.)
/// Must specify a "View" .nib file, whose File's Owner is a SubtreeView, or the TreeGraph will be
/// unable to instantiate node views.

@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *nodeViewNibName;


#pragma mark - Selection State

/// The unordered set of model nodes that are currently selected in the TreeGraph.  When no nodes
/// are selected, this is an empty NSSet.  It will never be nil (and attempting to set it to nil
/// will raise an exception).  Every member of this set must be a descendant of the TreeGraph's
/// modelRoot (or modelRoot itself).  If any member is not, TreeGraph will raise an exception.

@property (nonatomic, copy) NSSet *selectedModelNodes;

/// Convenience accessor that returns the selected node, if exactly one node is currently
/// selected.  Returns nil if zero, or more than one, nodes are currently selected.

@property (nonatomic, readonly) id <PSTreeGraphModelNode> singleSelectedModelNode;

/// Returns the bounding box of the selectedModelNodes.  The bounding box takes only the selected
/// nodes into account, disregarding any descendants they might have.

@property (nonatomic, readonly) CGRect selectionBounds;


#pragma mark - Node Hit-Testing

/// Returns the model node under the given point, which must be expressed in the TreeGraph's
/// interior (bounds) coordinate space.  If there is a collapsed subtree at the given point,
/// returns the model node at the root of the collapsed subtree.  If there is no model node
/// at the given point, returns nil.

#pragma mark - Sizing and Layout

/// A TreeGraph's minimumFrameSize is the size needed to accommodate its content (as currently
/// laid out) and margins.  Changes to the TreeGraph's content, layout, or margins will update
/// this.  When a TreeGraph is the documentView of an UIScrollView, its actual frame may be larger
/// than its minimumFrameSize, since we automatically expand the TreeGraph to always be at least
/// as large as the UIScrollView's clip area (contentView) to provide a nicer user experience.

@property (nonatomic, assign) CGSize minimumFrameSize;

/// If YES, and if the TreeGraph is the documentView of an UIScrollView, the TreeGraph will
/// automatically resize itself as needed to ensure that it always at least fills the content
/// area of its enclosing UIScrollView.  If NO, or if the TreeGraph is not the documentView of
/// an UIScrollView, the TreeGraph's size is determined only by its content and margins.

@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL resizesToFillEnclosingScrollView;

/// The style for tree graph orientation
/// @note See the TreeGraphOrientationStyle enumeration.

@property (nonatomic, assign) PSTreeGraphOrientationStyle treeGraphOrientation;

/// Is the TreeGraph flipped 
/// Flipped means the graph is drawn with the branches to the left or top and the root node
/// to the right or bottom.  Default is NO

@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL treeGraphFlipped;

/// Returns YES if the tree needs relayout.

- (BOOL) needsGraphLayout;

/// Marks the tree as needing relayout.

- (void) setNeedsGraphLayout;

/// Performs graph layout, if the tree is marked as needing it.  Returns the size computed for the
/// tree (not including contentMargin).

- (CGSize) layoutGraphIfNeeded;

/// Collapses the root node, if it is currently expanded.

- (void) collapseRoot;

/// Expands the root node, if it is currently collapsed.

- (void) expandRoot;

/// Toggles the expansion state of the TreeGraph's selectedModelNodes, expanding those that are
/// currently collapsed, and collapsing those that are currently expanded.

- (IBAction) toggleExpansionOfSelectedModelNodes:(id)sender;

/// Returns the bounding box of the node views that represent the specified modelNodes.  Model
/// nodes that aren't part of the displayed tree, or are part of a collapsed subtree, are ignored
/// and don't contribute to the returned bounding box.  The bounding box takes only the specified
/// nodes into account, disregarding any descendants they might have.

- (CGRect) boundsOfModelNodes:(NSSet *)modelNodes;


#pragma mark - Scrolling

/// Does a [self scrollRectToVisible:] with the bounding box of the specified model nodes.

- (void) scrollModelNodesToVisible:(NSSet *)modelNodes animated:(BOOL)animated;

/// Does a [self scrollRectToVisible:] with the bounding box of the selected model nodes.

- (void) scrollSelectedModelNodesToVisibleAnimated:(BOOL)animated;


#pragma mark - Animation Support

/// Whether the TreeGraph animates layout operations.  Defaults to YES.  If set to NO, layout
/// jumpst instantaneously to the tree's new state.

@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL animatesLayout;

/// Used to temporarily suppress layout animation during event tracking.  Layout animation happens
/// only if animatesLayout is YES and this is NO.

@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL layoutAnimationSuppressed;


#pragma mark - Layout Metrics

/// The amount of padding to leave between the displayed tree and each of the
/// four edges of the TreeGraph's bounds.

@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat contentMargin;

/// The horizonal spacing between each parent node and its child nodes.

@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat parentChildSpacing;

/// The vertical spacing betwen sibling nodes.

@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat siblingSpacing;


#pragma mark - Styling

// The fill color for the TreeGraph's content area.

// @property(copy) UIColor *backgroundColor;

/// The stroke color for node connecting lines.

@property (nonatomic, retain) UIColor *connectingLineColor;

/// The width for node connecting lines.

@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat connectingLineWidth;

/// The style for node connecting lines.
/// @note See the PSTreeGraphConnectingLineStyle enumeration.

@property (nonatomic, assign) PSTreeGraphConnectingLineStyle connectingLineStyle;

/// Defaults to NO.  If YES, a stroked outline is shown around each of the TreeGraph's
/// SubtreeViews.  This can be helpful for visualizing the TreeGraph's structure and layout.

@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL showsSubtreeFrames;


#pragma mark - Input and Navigation

/// Custom input view for navigation.
///
/// By default, this control supports a hardware keyboard unless this property is assigned
/// to another input view.
///
/// More Info:
///
/// A placeholder view is created to so the default keyboard is not presented to the user.
/// When a hardware keyboard is attached, touching the TreeGraph makes it first responder
/// and certain keyboard shortcuts become available for navigation. ie. the space bar
/// expands and collapses the current selection. The following keys; w, a, s, d, navigate
/// relative to the graph.
///
/// Custom navigation can be added by assigning a custom UIView to inputView, and linking
/// it up to some of the actions below.

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIView *inputView;

// Model relative navigation
- (void) moveToSiblingByRelativeIndex:(NSInteger)relativeIndex;
